## A Glimpse of My Journey

Born in the beautiful city of Recife, Pernambuco, Brazil, back in 1985. Since 2016, I've called Germany my home and my playground as a Front-End Developer at IBMiX DACH.

One of the most rewarding aspects of my life is being a father to a young boy, who, no matter how old he grows, will always be my little one. 🧒💕

## My Love for ReactJS

When it comes to development, my heart beats for ReactJS. It's more than just a library; it's a world of innovation and community. Every year, it evolves, bringing fresh tools and features to improve our development journey.

I've also been busy with personal projects, a sort of developer's playground. It's where I experiment, learn, and push my limits. 🚀💻

Whether you want to chat about ReactJS, my journey from Brazil to Germany, or the joys of fatherhood, feel free to reach out. Let's connect, explore, and create something great together! 😄👨‍💻🇧🇷🇩🇪
